# AngularJS website example

This is an AngularJS website example which includes a header a sidebar and a footer.

This should only be intended as a really simple start structure when creating a website.

This website is also using AngularJS UI-Router as a state machine that manages the URL and the login procedure.

In this example you can also understand how to pass parameters between the pages and trough the tabs in the first page.

See the [example](https://angularjs-website-example.netlify.com/).
